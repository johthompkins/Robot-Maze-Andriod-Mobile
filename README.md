This Simple Maze was my first ever Andriod V22 phone application. I made a google VR maze that allows you to navigate to the end of a maze with moving walls. This was created for a senior project for my BA in Computer Sciene. 

In This Repo there are a small amount of scripts, prefabs, materials, and other assets that were used to created the project. The repo display where I use to stand as my first project built in college, but not a current reflection of where I am at now.
